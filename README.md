# Stock_analysis

### This was a coding task set by Codedex in the Python course. I decided to code this using VS Code as I want to build a portfolio of python finance related projects. 

### This coding task is a simpler version of a time series stock analysis model that is used in the finance.

## Possible future improvements could be coding in as my Python coding skills improve.
